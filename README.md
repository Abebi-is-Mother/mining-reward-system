# 🪙 Mining Reward System – A Bitcoin-Native RPG Token Engine

**Mining Reward System** is a smart contract-based game engine for an RPG where players earn a native crypto token, **Deolax ($DEOLAX)**, by reaching milestones during gameplay. Built on the [Stacks](https://stacks.co) Bitcoin Layer 2 network using [Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/clarity), this project enables a play-to-earn economy where tokens are both functional and valuable.
